An intern asked me to create a program taht would easily clear up her desktop of all teh photos she takes for one of her jobs.
(When I say desktop, I mean teh Desktop directory was covered in different file types of photos.)

Here is what I created.

When the program is run, it will create folders based off the file type, specifically photos, ex. .jpg, .jpeg, .png.

That's really it, very simple but it works for her. ^.^
